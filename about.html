            <h2>&#8226;ABOUT</h2>
            <h1>Pre-launch information</h1>
            <p>Nextage launch is a truly a huge milestone for this enterprise as many sleepless nights and countless
                brain-frying sessions have been compensated for the sole-purpose of bringing the vision of PROJECT
                NEXTAGE to life. PROJECT NEXTAGE is the CEO’s vision for streaming music for free while having relaxing animation playing throughout the session. The highlight of this website is the lack of subscription for our main service which is streaming music. Thus, this platform is user-friendly as opposed to its counterpart. However, if we move on to more detail of what is Nextage?<br><br>Nextage is a website that host songs which are in a loop while displaying minimalistic animated “GIF” that gives the viewer a relaxing psychological effect.
                Nextage aims to take advantage of this effect to the next level “Nextage of aesthetic/relaxing”.
                It is a well-founded consensus that music or low ambient songs have a
                positive impact on students in all range of academics ranging from middle-school students to university students as it could calm the mood of the students albeit studying for
                their mid-term exams or college entrance exams. Therefore, Nextage purpose is to accompany their users not limited to students while their working on assignments/tasks in
                hopes that the user gets to experience the luxury of having an external party to provide well prepared conducive website which will enhance the working environment.
                It is well established that music/songs aid in working environment as many social experiments have been carried out in the mid-21st century that students often load YouTube
                interface to play music while they burn their midnight oil. Nextage took this study as an inspiration to create a website that not only plays music but also offer minimalistic
                “GIF” that have a calming effect on fidgeting. <br><br>We at Nextage recommend using laptop or PC as
                these devices will offer better UI as since it’s still at the early stage of launch, we target at the
                desktop audience. Mobile audience or clients will be able to stream the available music however the
                website will be less cut-edge as compared to the desktop versions. But fear not as closing into the
                official launch, the website will be optimized to all devices. Alongside better optimization, Nextage
                will be bringing products to this platform as well as other services which will be disclosed later. In
                 the events of purchasing products, the “Log in” & “Register” feature will be relevant. At the current
                 stage those features will be usable but not required for our main service.<br><br>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.Suspendisse aliquet id magna quis sollicitudin.
